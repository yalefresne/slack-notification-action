# slack-notification-action ðŸ’¬ 
Github action for sending notification on a Slack channel about CI/CD workflow.  
**Requirement**:
You must have a [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) configured to use this action.

## Input variables

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for more detailed information.

* `webhook_slack` - Your Incoming Webhook URL
* `channel_name` - Slack channel's name where the message will be posted
* `build_status` - Build job's status (Optionnal)
* `deploy_status` - Deploy job's status (Optionnal)

## More informations
`webhook_slack` : Your Incoming Webhook URL must not be publicly exposed, so store it in a [secret github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).  
`channel_name`: On recent version of Incoming Webhook, this variable has no effect.

## Example usage

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
